## Who am I?
My name is Brett, and I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Math-CS. I also compete for the Cross Country and Track & Field teams at UCSD!

## Programming History

I haven't really done much programming outside of my CS classes at UCSD, but I can say my favorite language so far is C++. I didn't like how C didn't have classes, and I appreciate that C++ is faster than Java. I'm currently looking for ways to expand my knowledge and experience as a programmer!
